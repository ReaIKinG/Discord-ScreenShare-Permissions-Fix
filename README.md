This Discord bot is designed to fix the screenshare permissions problem on your server. When a user moved to any voice channel id you provid, the bot will automatically assign them the "connect" role, granting them screenshare permissions. When the user leaves the voice channel, the role is automatically removed. Additionally, the bot periodically checks for offline users and removes the "connect" role from users who are not currently in a voice channel. This ensures that screenshare permissions are granted only to those who are actively using voice channels, optimizing the bot's functionality and user experience.
